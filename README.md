# RodinWorks Open Validation Hub

A community-driven, open, and non-compensated validation ecosystem for dental 3D printing.  
This repository enables dentists, dental labs, engineers, and hobbyists to collaboratively validate **Rodin resins, Ackuretta printers**, and other open-system 3D printing workflows.

Our mission:  
**Build the world’s most transparent, accurate, and community-maintained validation library for dental 3D printing.**

## 🔍 What This Project Is

This project blends **Crowd-Sourced** real-world testing with **True Open Source** contributions.

### **Crowd-Sourced**
Users submit real test results such as:
- Print success/failure data  
- Exposure settings  
- Accuracy (mm deviation)  
- Surface finish  
- Printer/environment conditions  

### **Open Source**
Validated profiles and data are shared under **CC BY-SA 4.0**, allowing:
- Use  
- Modification  
- Redistribution  
- Forking  

As long as attribution + share-alike are preserved.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Create a searchable library of resin–printer compatibility  
- Reduce wasted resin and failed prints  
- Enable open, repeatable, scientific validations  
- Provide manufacturers a community-backed validation channel  
- Support dental education and CE programs
